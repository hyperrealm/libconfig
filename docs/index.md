## About

*Libconfig* is a simple library for processing structured configuration 
files, like [this one](test.cfg.txt). This file format is more compact 
and more readable than XML. And unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is 
not necessary to do string parsing in application code.

*Libconfig* is very compact -- a fraction of the size of the _expat_ XML 
parser library. This makes it well-suited for memory-constrained systems 
like handheld devices.

The library includes bindings for both the C and C++ languages. It works 
on POSIX-compliant UNIX and UNIX-like systems (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, 
FreeBSD), Android, and Windows (2000, XP and later).
