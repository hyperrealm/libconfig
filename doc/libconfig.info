1 Introduction
**************

Libconfig is a library for reading, manipulating, and writing structured
configuration files.  The library features a fully reentrant parser and
includes bindings for both the C and C++ programming languages.

   The library runs on modern POSIX-compilant systems, such as Linux,
Solaris, and Mac OS X (Darwin), as well as on Microsoft Windows 2000/XP
and later (with either Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or later, or the GNU
toolchain via the MinGW environment).

1.1 Why Another Configuration File Library?
===========================================

There are several open-source configuration file libraries available as
of this writing.  This library was written because each of those
libraries falls short in one or more ways.  The main features of
libconfig that set it apart from the other libraries are:

   * A fully reentrant parser.  Independent configurations can be parsed
     in concurrent threads at the same time.

   * Both C and C++ bindings, as well as hooks to allow for the creation
     of wrappers in other languages.

   * A simple, structured configuration file format that is more
     readable and compact than XML and more flexible than the obsolete
     but prevalent Windows "INI" file format.

   * A low-footprint implementation (just 37K for the C library and 76K
     for the C++ library) that is suitable for memory-constrained
     systems.

   * Proper documentation.

1.2 Using the Library from a C Program
======================================

To use the library from C code, include the following preprocessor
directive in your source files:


     #include <libconfig.h>

   To link with the library, specify '-lconfig' as an argument to the
linker.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Using the Library from a C++ Program,  Next: Multithreading Issues,  Prev: Using the Library from a C Program,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Using the Library from a C++ Program
========================================

To use the library from C++, include the following preprocessor
directive in your source files:


     #include <libconfig.h++>

   Or, alternatively:


     #include <libconfig.hh>

   The C++ API classes are defined in the namespace 'libconfig', hence
the following statement may optionally be used:


     using namespace libconfig;

   To link with the library, specify '-lconfig++' as an argument to the
linker.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Multithreading Issues,  Next: Internationalization Issues,  Prev: Using the Library from a C++ Program,  Up: Introduction

1.4 Multithreading Issues
=========================

Libconfig is fully "reentrant"; the functions in the library do not make
use of global variables and do not maintain state between successive
calls.  Therefore two independent configurations may be safely
manipulated concurrently by two distinct threads.

   Libconfig is not "thread-safe".  The library is not aware of the
presence of threads and knows nothing about the host system's threading
model.  Therefore, if an instance of a configuration is to be accessed
from multiple threads, it must be suitably protected by synchronization
mechanisms like read-write locks or mutexes; the standard rules for safe
multithreaded access to shared data must be observed.

   Libconfig is not "async-safe".  Calls should not be made into the
library from signal handlers, because some of the C library routines
that it uses may not be async-safe.

   Libconfig is not guaranteed to be "cancel-safe".  Since it is not
aware of the host system's threading model, the library does not contain
any thread cancellation points.  In most cases this will not be an issue
for multithreaded programs.  However, be aware that some of the routines
in the library (namely those that read/write configurations from/to
files or streams) perform I/O using C library routines which may
potentially block; whether or not these C library routines are
cancel-safe depends on the host system.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Internationalization Issues,  Next: Compiling Using pkg-config,  Prev: Multithreading Issues,  Up: Introduction

1.5 Internationalization Issues
===============================

Libconfig does not natively support Unicode configuration files, but
string values may contain Unicode text encoded in UTF-8; such strings
will be treated as ordinary 8-bit ASCII text by the library.  It is the
responsibility of the calling program to perform the necessary
conversions to/from wide (wchar_t) strings using the wide string
conversion functions such as mbsrtowcs() and wcsrtombs() or the iconv()
function of the libiconv library.

   The textual representation of a floating point value varies by
locale.  However, the libconfig grammar specifies that floating point
values are represented using a period ('.')  as the radix symbol; this
is consistent with the grammar of most programming languages.  When a
configuration is read in or written out, libconfig temporarily changes
the LC_NUMERIC category of the locale of the calling thread to the "C"
locale to ensure consistent handling of floating point values regardless
of the locale(s) in use by the calling program.

   Note that the MinGW environment does not (as of this writing) provide
functions for changing the locale of the calling thread.  Therefore,
when using libconfig in that environment, the calling program is
responsible for changing the LC_NUMERIC category of the locale to the
"C" locale before reading or writing a configuration.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Compiling Using pkg-config,  Next: Version Test Macros,  Prev: Internationalization Issues,  Up: Introduction

1.6 Compiling Using pkg-config
==============================

On UNIX systems you can use the pkg-config utility (version 0.20 or
later) to automatically select the appropriate compiler and linker
switches for libconfig.  Ensure that the environment variable
'PKG_CONFIG_PATH' contains the absolute path to the 'lib/pkgconfig'
subdirectory of the libconfig installation.  Then, you can compile and
link C programs with libconfig as follows:

     gcc `pkg-config --cflags libconfig` myprogram.c -o myprogram \
         `pkg-config --libs libconfig`

   And similarly, for C++ programs:

     g++ `pkg-config --cflags libconfig++` myprogram.cpp -o myprogram \
         `pkg-config --libs libconfig++`


   Note the backticks in the above examples.

   When using autoconf, the 'PKG_CHECK_MODULES' m4 macro may be used to
check for the presence of a given version of libconfig, and set the
appropriate Makefile variables automatically.  For example:

     PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBCONFIGXX], [libconfig++ >= 1.4],,
       AC_MSG_ERROR([libconfig++ 1.4 or newer not found.])
     )

   In the above example, if libconfig++ version 1.4 or newer is found,
the Makefile variables 'LIBCONFIGXX_LIBS' and 'LIBCONFIGXX_CFLAGS' will
be set to the appropriate compiler and linker flags for compiling with
libconfig, and if it is not found, the configure script will abort with
an error to that effect.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Version Test Macros,  Prev: Compiling Using pkg-config,  Up: Introduction

1.7 Version Test Macros
=======================

The 'libconfig.h' header declares the following macros:

 -- Macro: LIBCONFIG_VER_MAJOR
 -- Macro: LIBCONFIG_VER_MINOR
 -- Macro: LIBCONFIG_VER_REVISION

     These macros represent the major version, minor version, and
     revision of the libconfig library.  For example, in libconfig 1.4
     these are defined as '1', '4', and '0', respectively.  These macros
     can be used in preprocessor directives to determine which libconfig
     features and/or APIs are present.  For example:

          #if (((LIBCONFIG_VER_MAJOR == 1) && (LIBCONFIG_VER_MINOR >= 4)) \
               || (LIBCONFIG_VER_MAJOR > 1))
            /* use features present in libconfig 1.4 and later */
          #endif

     These macros were introduced in libconfig 1.4.

   Similarly, the 'libconfig.h++' header declares the following macros:

 -- Macro: LIBCONFIGXX_VER_MAJOR
 -- Macro: LIBCONFIGXX_VER_MINOR
 -- Macro: LIBCONFIGXX_VER_REVISION

     These macros represent the major version, minor version, and
     revision of the libconfig++ library.

2 Configuration Files
*********************

Libconfig supports structured, hierarchical configurations.  These
configurations can be read from and written to files and manipulated in
memory.

   A "configuration" consists of a group of "settings", which associate
names with values.  A "value" can be one of the following:

   * A "scalar value": integer, 64-bit integer, floating-point number,
     boolean, or string
   * An "array", which is a sequence of scalar values, all of which must
     have the same type
   * A "group", which is a collection of settings
   * A "list", which is a sequence of values of any type, including
     other lists

   Consider the following configuration file for a hypothetical GUI
application, which illustrates all of the elements of the configuration
file grammar.


     # Example application configuration file

     version = "1.0";

     application:
     {
       window:
       {
         title = "My Application";
         size = { w = 640; h = 480; };
         pos = { x = 350; y = 250; };
       };

       list = ( ( "abc", 123, true ), 1.234, ( /* an empty list */) );

       books = ( { title  = "Treasure Island";
                   author = "Robert Louis Stevenson";
                   price  = 29.95;
                   qty    = 5; },
                 { title  = "Snow Crash";
                   author = "Neal Stephenson";
                   price  = 9.99;
                   qty    = 8; } );

       misc:
       {
         pi = 3.141592654;
         bigint = 9223372036854775807L;
         columns = [ "Last Name", "First Name", "MI" ];
         bitmask = 0x1FC3;
       };
     };

   Settings can be uniquely identified within the configuration by a
"path".  The path is a dot-separated sequence of names, beginning at a
top-level group and ending at the setting itself.  Each name in the path
is the name of a setting; if the setting has no name because it is an
element in a list or array, an integer index in square brackets can be
used as the name.

   For example, in our hypothetical configuration file, the path to the
'x' setting is 'application.window.pos.x'; the path to the 'version'
setting is simply 'version'; and the path to the 'title' setting of the
second book in the 'books' list is 'application.books.[1].title'.

   The datatype of a value is determined from the format of the value
itself.  If the value is enclosed in double quotes, it is treated as a
string.  If it looks like an integer or floating point number, it is
treated as such.  If it is one of the values 'TRUE', 'true', 'FALSE', or
'false' (or any other mixed-case version of those tokens, e.g., 'True'
or 'FaLsE'), it is treated as a boolean.  If it consists of a
comma-separated list of values enclosed in square brackets, it is
treated as an array.  And if it consists of a comma-separated list of
values enclosed in parentheses, it is treated as a list.  Any value
which does not meet any of these criteria is considered invalid and
results in a parse error.

   All names are case-sensitive.  They may consist only of alphanumeric
characters, dashes ('-'), underscores ('_'), and asterisks ('*'), and
must begin with a letter or asterisk.  No other characters are allowed.

   In C and C++, integer, 64-bit integer, floating point, and string
values are mapped to the types 'int', 'long long', 'double', and 'const
char *', respectively.  The boolean type is mapped to 'int' in C and
'bool' in C++.

   The following sections describe the elements of the configuration
file grammar in additional detail.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Settings,  Next: Groups,  Up: Configuration Files

2.1 Settings
============

A setting has the form:

   name = value ;

   or:

   name : value ;

   The trailing semicolon is optional.  Whitespace is not significant.

   The value may be a scalar value, an array, a group, or a list.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Groups,  Next: Arrays,  Prev: Settings,  Up: Configuration Files

2.2 Groups
==========

A group has the form:

   { settings ...  }

   Groups can contain any number of settings, but each setting must have
a unique name within the group.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Arrays,  Next: Lists,  Prev: Groups,  Up: Configuration Files

2.3 Arrays
==========

An array has the form:

   [ value, value ...  ]

   An array may have zero or more elements, but the elements must all be
scalar values of the same type.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Lists,  Next: Integer Values,  Prev: Arrays,  Up: Configuration Files

2.4 Lists
=========

A list has the form:

   ( value, value ...  )

   A list may have zero or more elements, each of which can be a scalar
value, an array, a group, or another list.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Integer Values,  Next: 64-bit Integer Values,  Prev: Lists,  Up: Configuration Files

2.5 Integer Values
==================

Integers can be represented in one of two ways: as a series of one or
more decimal digits ('0' - '9'), with an optional leading sign character
('+' or '-'); or as a hexadecimal value consisting of the characters
'0x' followed by a series of one or more hexadecimal digits ('0' - '9',
'A' - 'F', 'a' - 'f').


File: libconfig.info,  Node: 64-bit Integer Values,  Next: Floating Point Values,  Prev: Integer Values,  Up: Configuration Files

2.6 64-bit Integer Values
=========================

Long long (64-bit) integers are represented identically to integers,
except that an 'L' character is appended to indicate a 64-bit value.
For example, '0L' indicates a 64-bit integer value 0.  As of version 1.5
of the library, the trailing 'L' is optional; if the integer value
exceeds the range of a 32-bit integer, it will automatically be
interpreted as a 64-bit integer.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Floating Point Values,  Next: Boolean Values,  Prev: 64-bit Integer Values,  Up: Configuration Files

2.7 Floating Point Values
=========================

Floating point values consist of a series of one or more digits, one
decimal point, an optional leading sign character ('+' or '-'), and an
optional exponent.  An exponent consists of the letter 'E' or 'e', an
optional sign character, and a series of one or more digits.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Boolean Values,  Next: String Values,  Prev: Floating Point Values,  Up: Configuration Files

2.8 Boolean Values
==================

Boolean values may have one of the following values: 'true', 'false', or
any mixed-case variation thereof.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: String Values,  Next: Comments,  Prev: Boolean Values,  Up: Configuration Files

2.9 String Values
=================

String values consist of arbitrary text delimited by double quotes.
Literal double quotes can be escaped by preceding them with a backslash:
'\"'.  The escape sequences '\\', '\f', '\n', '\r', and '\t' are also
recognized, and have the usual meaning.

   In addition, the '\x' escape sequence is supported; this sequence
must be followed by exactly two hexadecimal digits, which represent an
8-bit ASCII value.  For example, '\xFF' represents the character with
ASCII code 0xFF.

   No other escape sequences are currently supported.

   Adjacent strings are automatically concatenated, as in C/C++ source
code.  This is useful for formatting very long strings as sequences of
shorter strings.  For example, the following constructs are equivalent:

   * '"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."'

   * '"The quick brown fox"'
     '" jumped over the lazy dog."'

   * '"The quick" /* comment */ " brown fox " // another comment'
     '"jumped over the lazy dog."'


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Comments,  Next: Include Directives,  Prev: String Values,  Up: Configuration Files

2.10 Comments
=============

Three types of comments are allowed within a configuration:

   * Script-style comments.  All text beginning with a '#' character to
     the end of the line is ignored.

   * C-style comments.  All text, including line breaks, between a
     starting '/*' sequence and an ending '*/' sequence is ignored.

   * C++-style comments.  All text beginning with a '//' sequence to the
     end of the line is ignored.

   As expected, comment delimiters appearing within quoted strings are
treated as literal text.

   Comments are ignored when the configuration is read in, so they are
not treated as part of the configuration.  Therefore if the
configuration is written back out to a stream, any comments that were
present in the original configuration will be lost.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Include Directives,  Prev: Comments,  Up: Configuration Files

2.11 Include Directives
=======================

A configuration file may "include" the contents of another file using an
include directive.  This directive has the effect of inlining the
contents of the named file at the point of inclusion.

   An include directive must appear on its own line in the input.  It
has the form:

   @include "filename"

   Any backslashes or double quotes in the filename must be escaped as
'\\' and '\"', respectively.

   For example, consider the following two configuration files:

     # file: quote.cfg
     quote = "Criticism may not be agreeable, but it is necessary."
             " It fulfils the same function as pain in the human"
             " body. It calls attention to an unhealthy state of"
             " things.\n"
             "\t--Winston Churchill";

     # file: test.cfg
     info: {
       name = "Winston Churchill";
       @include "quote.cfg"
       country = "UK";
     };

   Include files may be nested to a maximum of 10 levels; exceeding this
limit results in a parse error.

   Like comments, include directives are not part of the configuration
file syntax.  They are processed before the configuration itself is
parsed.  Therefore, they are not preserved when the configuration is
written back out to a stream.  There is presently no support for
programmatically inserting include directives into a configuration.

3 The C API
***********

This chapter describes the C library API. The type config_t represents a
configuration, and the type config_setting_t represents a configuration
setting.

   The boolean values 'CONFIG_TRUE' and 'CONFIG_FALSE' are macros
defined as '(1)' and '(0)', respectively.

 -- Function: void config_init (config_t * CONFIG)
 -- Function: void config_destroy (config_t * CONFIG)

     These functions initialize and destroy the configuration object
     CONFIG.

     'config_init()' initializes the config_t structure pointed to by
     CONFIG as a new, empty configuration.

     'config_destroy()' destroys the configuration CONFIG, deallocating
     all memory associated with the configuration, but does not attempt
     to deallocate the config_t structure itself.

 -- Function: int config_read (config_t * CONFIG, FILE * STREAM)

     This function reads and parses a configuration from the given
     STREAM into the configuration object CONFIG.  It returns
     'CONFIG_TRUE' on success, or 'CONFIG_FALSE' on failure; the
     'config_error_text()', 'config_error_file()',
     'config_error_line()', and 'config_error_type()' functions,
     described below, can be used to obtain information about the error.

 -- Function: int config_read_file (config_t * CONFIG,
          const char * FILENAME)

     This function reads and parses a configuration from the file named
     FILENAME into the configuration object CONFIG.  It returns
     'CONFIG_TRUE' on success, or 'CONFIG_FALSE' on failure; the
     'config_error_text()' and 'config_error_line()' functions,
     described below, can be used to obtain information about the error.

 -- Function: int config_read_string (config_t * CONFIG,
          const char * STR)

     This function reads and parses a configuration from the string STR
     into the configuration object CONFIG.  It returns 'CONFIG_TRUE' on
     success, or 'CONFIG_FALSE' on failure; the 'config_error_text()'
     and 'config_error_line()' functions, described below, can be used
     to obtain information about the error.

 -- Function: void config_write (const config_t * CONFIG, FILE * STREAM)

     This function writes the configuration CONFIG to the given STREAM.

 -- Function: int config_write_file (config_t * CONFIG,
          const char * FILENAME)

     This function writes the configuration CONFIG to the file named
     FILENAME.  It returns 'CONFIG_TRUE' on success, or 'CONFIG_FALSE'
     on failure.

 -- Function: const char * config_error_text (const config_t * CONFIG)
 -- Function: const char * config_error_file (const config_t * CONFIG)
 -- Function: int config_error_line (const config_t * CONFIG)

     These functions, which are implemented as macros, return the text,
     filename, and line number of the parse error, if one occurred
     during a call to 'config_read()', 'config_read_string()', or
     'config_read_file()'.  Storage for the strings returned by
     'config_error_text()' and 'config_error_file()' are managed by the
     library and released automatically when the configuration is
     destroyed; these strings must not be freed by the caller.  If the
     error occurred in text that was read from a string or stream,
     'config_error_file()' will return NULL.

 -- Function: config_error_t config_error_type (const config_t * CONFIG)
     This function, which is implemented as a macro, returns the type of
     error that occurred during the last call to one of the read or
     write functions.  The CONFIG_ERROR_T type is an enumeration with
     the following values: 'CONFIG_ERR_NONE', 'CONFIG_ERR_FILE_IO',
     'CONFIG_ERR_PARSE'.  These represent success, a file I/O error, and
     a parsing error, respectively.

 -- Function: void config_set_include_dir (config_t *CONFIG,
          const char *INCLUDE_DIR)
 -- Function: const char * config_get_include_dir
          (const config_t *CONFIG)

     'config_set_include_dir()' specifies the include directory,
     INCLUDE_DIR, relative to which the files specified in '@include'
     directives will be located for the configuration CONFIG.  By
     default, there is no include directory, and all include files are
     expected to be relative to the current working directory.  If
     INCLUDE_DIR is 'NULL', the default behavior is reinstated.

     For example, if the include directory is set to '/usr/local/etc',
     the include directive '@include "configs/extra.cfg"' would include
     the file '/usr/local/etc/configs/extra.cfg'.

     'config_get_include_dir()' returns the current include directory
     for the configuration CONFIG, or 'NULL' if none is set.

 -- Function: void config_set_options (config_t *CONFIG, int OPTIONS)
 -- Function: int config_get_options (config_t *CONFIG)

     These functions set and get the options for the configuration
     CONFIG.  The options affect how configurations are read and
     written.  The following options are defined:

     'CONFIG_OPTION_AUTOCONVERT'
          Turning this option on enables number auto-conversion for the
          configuration.  When this feature is enabled, an attempt to
          retrieve a floating point setting's value into an integer (or
          vice versa), or store an integer to a floating point setting's
          value (or vice versa) will cause the library to silently
          perform the necessary conversion (possibly leading to loss of
          data), rather than reporting failure.  By default this option
          is turned off.

     'CONFIG_OPTION_SEMICOLON_SEPARATORS'
          This option controls whether a semicolon (';') is output after
          each setting when the configuration is written to a file or
          stream.  (The semicolon separators are optional in the
          configuration syntax.)  By default this option is turned on.

     'CONFIG_OPTION_COLON_ASSIGNMENT_FOR_GROUPS'
          This option controls whether a colon (':') is output between
          each group setting's name and its value when the configuration
          is written to a file or stream.  If the option is turned off,
          an equals sign ('=') is output instead.  (These tokens are
          interchangeable in the configuration syntax.)  By default this
          option is turned on.

     'CONFIG_OPTION_COLON_ASSIGNMENT_FOR_NON_GROUPS'
          This option controls whether a colon (':') is output between
          each non-group setting's name and its value when the
          configuration is written to a file or stream.  If the option
          is turned off, an equals sign ('=') is output instead.  (These
          tokens are interchangeable in the configuration syntax.)  By
          default this option is turned off.

     'CONFIG_OPTION_OPEN_BRACE_ON_SEPARATE_LINE'
          This option controls whether an open brace ('{') will be
          written on its own line when the configuration is written to a
          file or stream.  If the option is turned off, the brace will
          be written at the end of the previous line.  By default this
          option is turned on.

 -- Function: void config_set_auto_convert (config_t *CONFIG, int FLAG)
 -- Function: int config_get_auto_convert (const config_t *CONFIG)

     These functions get and set the 'CONFIG_OPTION_AUTO_CONVERT'
     option.  They are obsoleted by the 'config_set_options()' and
     'config_get_options()' functions described above.

 -- Function: void config_set_default_format (config_t * CONFIG,
          short FORMAT)
 -- Function: short config_get_default_format (config_t * CONFIG)

     These functions, which are implemented as macros, set and get the
     default external format for settings in the configuration CONFIG.
     If a non-default format has not been set for a setting with
     'config_setting_set_format()', this configuration-wide default
     format will be used instead when that setting is written to a file
     or stream.

 -- Function: void config_set_tab_width (config_t * CONFIG,
          unsigned short WIDTH)
 -- Function: unsigned short config_get_tab_width
          (const config_t * CONFIG)

     These functions, which are implemented as macros, set and get the
     tab width for the configuration CONFIG.  The tab width affects the
     formatting of the configuration when it is written to a file or
     stream: each level of nesting is indented by WIDTH spaces, or by a
     single tab character if WIDTH is 0.  The tab width has no effect on
     parsing.

     Valid tab widths range from 0 to 15.  The default tab width is 2.

 -- Function: int config_lookup_int (const config_t * CONFIG,
          const char * PATH, int * VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_lookup_int64 (const config_t * CONFIG,
          const char * PATH, long long * VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_lookup_float (const config_t * CONFIG,
          const char * PATH, double * VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_lookup_bool (const config_t * CONFIG,
          const char * PATH, int * VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_lookup_string (const config_t * CONFIG,
          const char * PATH, const char ** VALUE)

     These functions look up the value of the setting in the
     configuration CONFIG specified by the path PATH.  They store the
     value of the setting at VALUE and return 'CONFIG_TRUE' on success.
     If the setting was not found or if the type of the value did not
     match the type requested, they leave the data pointed to by VALUE
     unmodified and return 'CONFIG_FALSE'.

     Storage for the string returned by 'config_lookup_string()' is
     managed by the library and released automatically when the setting
     is destroyed or when the setting's value is changed; the string
     must not be freed by the caller.

 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_lookup (const config_t * CONFIG,
          const char * PATH)

     This function locates the setting in the configuration CONFIG
     specified by the path PATH.  It returns a pointer to the
     'config_setting_t' structure on success, or 'NULL' if the setting
     was not found.

 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_lookup
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, const char * PATH)

     This function locates a setting by a path PATH relative to the
     setting SETTING.  It returns a pointer to the 'config_setting_t'
     structure on success, or 'NULL' if the setting was not found.

 -- Function: int config_setting_get_int
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)
 -- Function: long long config_setting_get_int64
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)
 -- Function: double config_setting_get_float
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)
 -- Function: int config_setting_get_bool
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)
 -- Function: const char * config_setting_get_string
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     These functions return the value of the given SETTING.  If the type
     of the setting does not match the type requested, a 0 or 'NULL'
     value is returned.  Storage for the string returned by
     'config_setting_get_string()' is managed by the library and
     released automatically when the setting is destroyed or when the
     setting's value is changed; the string must not be freed by the
     caller.

 -- Function: int config_setting_set_int (config_setting_t * SETTING,
          int VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_int64 (config_setting_t * SETTING,
          long long VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_float (config_setting_t * SETTING,
          double VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_bool (config_setting_t * SETTING,
          int VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_string (config_setting_t * SETTING,
          const char * VALUE)

     These functions set the value of the given SETTING to VALUE.  On
     success, they return 'CONFIG_TRUE'.  If the setting does not match
     the type of the value, they return 'CONFIG_FALSE'.
     'config_setting_set_string()' makes a copy of the passed string
     VALUE, so it may be subsequently freed or modified by the caller
     without affecting the value of the setting.

 -- Function: int config_setting_lookup_int
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, const char * NAME,
          int * VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_lookup_int64
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, const char * NAME,
          long long * VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_lookup_float
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, const char * NAME,
          double * VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_lookup_bool
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, const char * NAME,
          int * VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_lookup_string
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, const char * NAME,
          const char ** VALUE)

     These functions look up the value of the child setting named NAME
     of the setting SETTING.  They store the value at VALUE and return
     'CONFIG_TRUE' on success.  If the setting was not found or if the
     type of the value did not match the type requested, they leave the
     data pointed to by VALUE unmodified and return 'CONFIG_FALSE'.

     Storage for the string returned by 'config_setting_lookup_string()'
     is managed by the library and released automatically when the
     setting is destroyed or when the setting's value is changed; the
     string must not be freed by the caller.

 -- Function: short config_setting_get_format
          (config_setting_t * SETTING)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_format (config_setting_t * SETTING,
          short FORMAT)

     These functions get and set the external format for the setting
     SETTING.

     The FORMAT must be one of the constants 'CONFIG_FORMAT_DEFAULT' or
     'CONFIG_FORMAT_HEX'.  All settings support the
     'CONFIG_FORMAT_DEFAULT' format.  The 'CONFIG_FORMAT_HEX' format
     specifies hexadecimal formatting for integer values, and hence only
     applies to settings of type 'CONFIG_TYPE_INT' and
     'CONFIG_TYPE_INT64'.  If FORMAT is invalid for the given setting,
     it is ignored.

     If a non-default format has not been set for the setting,
     'config_setting_get_format()' returns the default format for the
     configuration, as set by 'config_set_default_format()'.

     'config_setting_set_format()' returns 'CONFIG_TRUE' on success and
     'CONFIG_FALSE' on failure.

 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_get_member
          (config_setting_t * SETTING, const char * NAME)

     This function fetches the child setting named NAME from the group
     SETTING.  It returns the requested setting on success, or 'NULL' if
     the setting was not found or if SETTING is not a group.

 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_get_elem
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, unsigned int INDEX)

     This function fetches the element at the given index INDEX in the
     setting SETTING, which must be an array, list, or group.  It
     returns the requested setting on success, or 'NULL' if INDEX is out
     of range or if SETTING is not an array, list, or group.

 -- Function: int config_setting_get_int_elem
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX)
 -- Function: long long config_setting_get_int64_elem
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX)
 -- Function: double config_setting_get_float_elem
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX)
 -- Function: int config_setting_get_bool_elem
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX)
 -- Function: const char * config_setting_get_string_elem
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX)

     These functions return the value at the specified index INDEX in
     the setting SETTING.  If the setting is not an array or list, or if
     the type of the element does not match the type requested, or if
     INDEX is out of range, they return 0 or 'NULL'.  Storage for the
     string returned by 'config_setting_get_string_elem()' is managed by
     the library and released automatically when the setting is
     destroyed or when its value is changed; the string must not be
     freed by the caller.

 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_set_int_elem
          (config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX, int VALUE)
 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_set_int64_elem
          (config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX, long long VALUE)
 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_set_float_elem
          (config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX, double VALUE)
 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_set_bool_elem
          (config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX, int VALUE)
 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_set_string_elem
          (config_setting_t * SETTING, int INDEX, const char * VALUE)

     These functions set the value at the specified index INDEX in the
     setting SETTING to VALUE.  If INDEX is negative, a new element is
     added to the end of the array or list.  On success, these functions
     return a pointer to the setting representing the element.  If the
     setting is not an array or list, or if the setting is an array and
     the type of the array does not match the type of the value, or if
     INDEX is out of range, they return 'NULL'.
     'config_setting_set_string_elem()' makes a copy of the passed
     string VALUE, so it may be subsequently freed or modified by the
     caller without affecting the value of the setting.

 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_add
          (config_setting_t * PARENT, const char * NAME, int TYPE)

     This function adds a new child setting or element to the setting
     PARENT, which must be a group, array, or list.  If PARENT is an
     array or list, the NAME parameter is ignored and may be 'NULL'.

     The function returns the new setting on success, or 'NULL' if
     PARENT is not a group, array, or list; or if there is already a
     child setting of PARENT named NAME; or if TYPE is invalid.  If TYPE
     is a scalar type, the new setting will have a default value of 0,
     0.0, 'false', or 'NULL', as appropriate.

 -- Function: int config_setting_remove (config_setting_t * PARENT,
          const char * NAME)

     This function removes and destroys the setting named NAME from the
     parent setting PARENT, which must be a group.  Any child settings
     of the setting are recursively destroyed as well.

     The function returns 'CONFIG_TRUE' on success.  If PARENT is not a
     group, or if it has no setting with the given name, it returns
     'CONFIG_FALSE'.

 -- Function: int config_setting_remove_elem (config_setting_t * PARENT,
          unsigned int INDEX)

     This function removes the child setting at the given index INDEX
     from the setting PARENT, which must be a group, list, or array.
     Any child settings of the removed setting are recursively destroyed
     as well.

     The function returns 'CONFIG_TRUE' on success.  If PARENT is not a
     group, list, or array, or if INDEX is out of range, it returns
     'CONFIG_FALSE'.

 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_root_setting
          (const config_t * CONFIG)

     This function returns the root setting for the configuration
     CONFIG.  The root setting is a group.

 -- Function: const char * config_setting_name
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     This function returns the name of the given SETTING, or 'NULL' if
     the setting has no name.  Storage for the returned string is
     managed by the library and released automatically when the setting
     is destroyed; the string must not be freed by the caller.

 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_parent
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     This function returns the parent setting of the given SETTING, or
     'NULL' if SETTING is the root setting.

 -- Function: int config_setting_is_root
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     This function returns 'CONFIG_TRUE' if the given SETTING is the
     root setting, and 'CONFIG_FALSE' otherwise.

 -- Function: int config_setting_index
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     This function returns the index of the given SETTING within its
     parent setting.  If SETTING is the root setting, this function
     returns -1.

 -- Function: int config_setting_length
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     This function returns the number of settings in a group, or the
     number of elements in a list or array.  For other types of
     settings, it returns 0.

 -- Function: int config_setting_type (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     This function returns the type of the given SETTING.  The return
     value is one of the constants 'CONFIG_TYPE_INT',
     'CONFIG_TYPE_INT64', 'CONFIG_TYPE_FLOAT', 'CONFIG_TYPE_STRING',
     'CONFIG_TYPE_BOOL', 'CONFIG_TYPE_ARRAY', 'CONFIG_TYPE_LIST', or
     'CONFIG_TYPE_GROUP'.

 -- Function: int config_setting_is_group
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)
 -- Function: int config_setting_is_array
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)
 -- Function: int config_setting_is_list
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     These convenience functions, which are implemented as macros, test
     if the setting SETTING is of a given type.  They return
     'CONFIG_TRUE' or 'CONFIG_FALSE'.

 -- Function: int config_setting_is_aggregate
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)
 -- Function: int config_setting_is_scalar
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)
 -- Function: int config_setting_is_number
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     These convenience functions, which are implemented as macros, test
     if the setting SETTING is of an aggregate type (a group, array, or
     list), of a scalar type (integer, 64-bit integer, floating point,
     boolean, or string), and of a number (integer, 64-bit integer, or
     floating point), respectively.  They return 'CONFIG_TRUE' or
     'CONFIG_FALSE'.

 -- Function: const char * config_setting_source_file
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     This function returns the name of the file from which the setting
     SETTING was read, or NULL if the setting was not read from a file.
     This information is useful for reporting application-level errors.
     Storage for the returned string is managed by the library and
     released automatically when the configuration is destroyed; the
     string must not be freed by the caller.

 -- Function: unsigned int config_setting_source_line
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     This function returns the line number of the configuration file or
     stream at which the setting SETTING was read, or 0 if no line
     number is available.  This information is useful for reporting
     application-level errors.

 -- Function: void config_setting_set_hook (config_setting_t * SETTING,
          void * HOOK)
 -- Function: void * config_setting_get_hook
          (const config_setting_t * SETTING)

     These functions make it possible to attach arbitrary data to each
     setting structure, for instance a "wrapper" or "peer" object
     written in another programming language.  The destructor function,
     if one has been supplied via a call to 'config_set_destructor()',
     will be called by the library to dispose of this data when the
     setting itself is destroyed.  There is no default destructor.

 -- Function: void config_set_destructor (config_t * CONFIG,
          void (* DESTRUCTOR)(void *))

     This function assigns the destructor function DESTRUCTOR for the
     configuration CONFIG.  This function accepts a single 'void *'
     argument and has no return value.  See 'config_setting_set_hook()'
     above for more information.

4 The C++ API
*************

This chapter describes the C++ library API. The class 'Config'
represents a configuration, and the class 'Setting' represents a
configuration setting.  Note that by design, neither of these classes
provides a public copy constructor or assignment operator.  Therefore,
instances of these classes may only be passed between functions via
references or pointers.

   The library defines a group of exceptions, all of which extend the
common base exception 'ConfigException'.

   A 'SettingTypeException' is thrown when the type of a setting's value
does not match the type requested.

 -- Method on SettingTypeException: SettingTypeException
          (const Setting &SETTING)
 -- Method on SettingTypeException: SettingTypeException
          (const Setting &SETTING, int INDEX)
 -- Method on SettingTypeException: SettingTypeException
          (const Setting &SETTING, const char *NAME)

     These methods construct 'SettingTypeException' objects for the
     given SETTING and/or member INDEX or NAME.

   A 'SettingNotFoundException' is thrown when a setting is not found.

 -- Method on SettingNotFoundException: SettingNotFoundException
          (const Setting &SETTING, int INDEX)
 -- Method on SettingNotFoundException: SettingNotFoundException
          (const Setting &SETTING, const char *NAME)
 -- Method on SettingNotFoundException: SettingNotFoundException
          (const char *PATH)

     These methods construct 'SettingTypeException' objects for the
     given SETTING and member INDEX or NAME, or path PATH.

   A 'SettingNameException' is thrown when an attempt is made to add a
new setting with a non-unique or invalid name.

 -- Method on SettingNameException: SettingNameException
          (const Setting &SETTING, const char *NAME)

     This method constructs a 'SettingNameExcpetion' object for the
     given SETTING and member name NAME.

   A 'ParseException' is thrown when a parse error occurs while reading
a configuration from a stream.

 -- Method on ParseException: ParseException (const char *FILE,
          int LINE, const char *ERROR)

     This method constructs a 'ParseException' object with the given
     filename FILE, line number LINE, and error message ERROR.

   A 'FileIOException' is thrown when an I/O error occurs while
reading/writing a configuration from/to a file.

   'SettingTypeException', 'SettingNotFoundException', and
'SettingNameException' all extend the common base exception
'SettingException', which provides the following method:

 -- Method on SettingException: const char * getPath ()

     Returns the path to the setting associated with the exception, or
     'NULL' if there is no applicable path.

   The remainder of this chapter describes the methods for manipulating
configurations and configuration settings.

 -- Method on Config: Config ()
 -- Method on Config: ~Config ()

     These methods create and destroy 'Config' objects.

 -- Method on Config: void read (FILE * STREAM)
 -- Method on Config: void write (FILE * STREAM)

     The 'read()' method reads and parses a configuration from the given
     STREAM.  A 'ParseException' is thrown if a parse error occurs.

     The 'write()' method writes the configuration to the given STREAM.

 -- Method on Config: void readFile (const char * FILENAME)
 -- Method on Config: void writeFile (const char * FILENAME)

     The 'readFile()' method reads and parses a configuration from the
     file named FILENAME.  A 'ParseException' is thrown if a parse error
     occurs.  A 'FileIOException' is thrown if the file cannot be read.

     The 'writeFile()' method writes the configuration to the file named
     FILENAME.  A 'FileIOException' is thrown if the file cannot be
     written.

 -- Method on Config: void readString (const char * STR)
 -- Method on Config: void readString (const std::string &STR)

     These methods read and parse a configuration from the string STR.
     A 'ParseException' is thrown if a parse error occurs.

 -- Method on ParseException: const char * getError ()
 -- Method on ParseException: const char * getFile ()
 -- Method on ParseException: int getLine ()

     If a call to 'readFile()', 'readString()', or 'read()' resulted in
     a 'ParseException', these methods can be called on the exception
     object to obtain the text, filename, and line number of the parse
     error.  Storage for the strings returned by 'getError()' and
     'getFile()' are managed by the library; the strings must not be
     freed by the caller.

 -- Method on Config: void setIncludeDir (const char *INCLUDEDIR)
 -- Method on Config: const char * getIncludeDir ()

     'setIncludeDir()' specifies the include directory, INCLUDEDIR,
     relative to which the files specified in '@include' directives will
     be located for the configuration.  By default, there is no include
     directory, and all include files are expected to be relative to the
     current working directory.  If INCLUDEDIR is 'NULL', the default
     behavior is reinstated.

     For example, if the include directory is set to '/usr/local/etc',
     the include directive '@include "configs/extra.cfg"' would include
     the file '/usr/local/etc/configs/extra.cfg'.

     'getIncludeDir()' returns the current include directory for the
     configuration, or 'NULL' if none is set.

 -- Method on Config: void setOptions (int OPTIONS)
 -- Method on Config: int getOptions ()

     These methods set and get the options for the configuration.  The
     options affect how configurations are read and written.  The
     following options are defined:

     'OptionAutoConvert'
          Turning this option on enables number auto-conversion for the
          configuration.  When this feature is enabled, an attempt to
          retrieve a floating point setting's value into an integer (or
          vice versa), or store an integer to a floating point setting's
          value (or vice versa) will cause the library to silently
          perform the necessary conversion (possibly leading to loss of
          data), rather than reporting failure.  By default this option
          is turned off.

     'OptionSemicolonSeparators'
          This option controls whether a semicolon (';') is output after
          each setting when the configuration is written to a file or
          stream.  (The semicolon separators are optional in the
          configuration syntax.)  By default this option is turned on.

     'OptionColonAssignmentForGroups'
          This option controls whether a colon (':') is output between
          each group setting's name and its value when the configuration
          is written to a file or stream.  If the option is turned off,
          an equals sign ('=') is output instead.  (These tokens are
          interchangeable in the configuration syntax.)  By default this
          option is turned on.

     'OptionColonAssignmentForNonGroups'
          This option controls whether a colon (':') is output between
          each non-group setting's name and its value when the
          configuration is written to a file or stream.  If the option
          is turned off, an equals sign ('=') is output instead.  (These
          tokens are interchangeable in the configuration syntax.)  By
          default this option is turned off.

     'OptionOpenBraceOnSeparateLine'
          This option controls whether an open brace ('{') will be
          written on its own line when the configuration is written to a
          file or stream.  If the option is turned off, the brace will
          be written at the end of the previous line.  By default this
          option is turned on.

 -- Method on Config: void setAutoConvert (bool FLAG)
 -- Method on Config: bool getAutoConvert ()

     These methods get and set the 'OptionAutoConvert' option.  They are
     obsoleted by the 'setOptions()' and 'getOptions()' methods
     described above.

 -- Method on Config: void setDefaultFormat (Setting::Format FORMAT)
 -- Method on Config: Setting::Format getDefaultFormat ()

     These methods set and get the default external format for settings
     in the configuration.  If a non-default format has not been set for
     a setting with 'Setting::setFormat()', this configuration-wide
     default format will be used instead when that setting is written to
     a file or stream.

 -- Method on Config: void setTabWidth (unsigned short WIDTH)
 -- Method on Config: unsigned short getTabWidth ()

     These methods set and get the tab width for the configuration.  The
     tab width affects the formatting of the configuration when it is
     written to a file or stream: each level of nesting is indented by
     WIDTH spaces, or by a single tab character if WIDTH is 0.  The tab
     width has no effect on parsing.

     Valid tab widths range from 0 to 15.  The default tab width is 2.

 -- Method on Config: Setting & getRoot ()

     This method returns the root setting for the configuration, which
     is a group.

 -- Method on Config: Setting & lookup (const std::string &PATH)
 -- Method on Config: Setting & lookup (const char * PATH)

     These methods locate the setting specified by the path PATH.  If
     the requested setting is not found, a 'SettingNotFoundException' is
     thrown.

 -- Method on Config: bool exists (const std::string &PATH)
 -- Method on Config: bool exists (const char *PATH)

     These methods test if a setting with the given PATH exists in the
     configuration.  They return 'true' if the setting exists, and
     'false' otherwise.  These methods do not throw exceptions.

 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const char *PATH, bool &VALUE)
 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const std::string &PATH,
          bool &VALUE)

 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const char *PATH, int &VALUE)
 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const std::string &PATH,
          int &VALUE)

 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const char *PATH,
          unsigned int &VALUE)
 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const std::string &PATH,
          unsigned int &VALUE)

 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const char *PATH,
          long long &VALUE)
 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const std::string &PATH,
          long long &VALUE)

 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const char *PATH, float &VALUE)
 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const std::string &PATH,
          float &VALUE)

 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const char *PATH, double &VALUE)
 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const std::string &PATH,
          double &VALUE)

 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const char *PATH,
          const char *&VALUE)
 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const std::string &PATH,
          const char *&VALUE)

 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const char *PATH,
          std::string &VALUE)
 -- Method on Config: bool lookupValue (const std::string &PATH,
          std::string &VALUE)

     These are convenience methods for looking up the value of a setting
     with the given PATH.  If the setting is found and is of an
     appropriate type, the value is stored in VALUE and the method
     returns 'true'.  Otherwise, VALUE is left unmodified and the method
     returns 'false'.  These methods do not throw exceptions.

     Storage for const char * values is managed by the library and
     released automatically when the setting is destroyed or when its
     value is changed; the string must not be freed by the caller.  For
     safety and convenience, always assigning string values to a
     'std::string' is suggested.

     Since these methods have boolean return values and do not throw
     exceptions, they can be used within boolean logic expressions.  The
     following example presents a concise way to look up three values at
     once and perform error handling if any of them are not found or are
     of the wrong type:


          int var1;
          double var2;
          const char *var3;

          if(config.lookupValue("values.var1", var1)
             && config.lookupValue("values.var2", var2)
             && config.lookupValue("values.var3", var3))
          {
            // use var1, var2, var3
          }
          else
          {
            // error handling here
          }

     This approach also takes advantage of the short-circuit evaluation
     rules of C++, e.g., if the first lookup fails (returning 'false'),
     the remaining lookups are skipped entirely.

 -- Method on Setting: operator bool ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator int ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator unsigned int ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator long ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator unsigned long ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator long long ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator unsigned long long ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator float ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator double ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator const char * ()
 -- Method on Setting: operator std::string ()
 -- Method on Setting: const char * c_str ()

     These cast operators allow a 'Setting' object to be assigned to a
     variable of type bool if it is of type 'TypeBoolean'; int, unsigned
     int; 'long long' or 'unsigned long long' if it is of type
     'TypeInt64', float or double if it is of type 'TypeFloat'; or const char *
     or std::string if it is of type 'TypeString'.

     Values of type 'TypeInt' or 'TypeInt64' may be assigned to
     variables of type long, or unsigned long, depending on the sizes of
     those types on the host system.

     Storage for const char * return values is managed by the library
     and released automatically when the setting is destroyed or when
     its value is changed; the string must not be freed by the caller.
     For safety and convenience, always assigning string return values
     to a 'std::string' is suggested.

     The following examples demonstrate this usage:

          long width = config.lookup("application.window.size.w");

          bool splashScreen = config.lookup("application.splash_screen");

          std::string title = config.lookup("application.window.title");

     Note that certain conversions can lead to loss of precision or
     clipping of values, e.g., assigning a negative value to an unsigned
     int (in which case the value will be treated as 0), or a
     double-precision value to a float.  The library does not treat
     these lossy conversions as errors.

     Perhaps surprisingly, the following code in particular will cause a
     compiler error:

          std::string title;
          .
          .
          .
          title = config.lookup("application.window.title");

     This is because the assignment operator of 'std::string' is being
     invoked with a 'Setting &' as an argument.  The compiler is unable
     to make an implicit conversion because both the 'const char *' and
     the 'std::string' cast operators of 'Setting' are equally
     appropriate.  This is not a bug in libconfig; providing only the
     'const char *' cast operator would resolve this particular
     ambiguity, but would cause assignments to 'std::string' like the
     one in the previous example to produce a compiler error.  (To
     understand why, see section 11.4.1 of The C++ Programming
     Language.)

     The solution to this problem is to use an explicit conversion that
     avoids the construction of an intermediate 'std::string' object, as
     follows:

          std::string title;
          .
          .
          .
          title = (const char *)config.lookup("application.window.title");

     Or, alternatively, use the 'c_str()' method, which has the same
     effect:

          std::string title;
          .
          .
          .
          title = config.lookup("application.window.title").c_str();

     If the assignment is invalid due to a type mismatch, a
     'SettingTypeException' is thrown.

 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator= (bool VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator= (int VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator= (long VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator= (const long long &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator= (float VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator= (const double &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator= (const char *VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator= (const std::string &VALUE)

     These assignment operators allow values of type bool, int, long,
     long long, float, double, const char *, and std::string to be
     assigned to a setting.  In the case of strings, the library makes a
     copy of the passed string VALUE, so it may be subsequently freed or
     modified by the caller without affecting the value of the setting.

     The following example code looks up a (presumably) integer setting
     and changes its value:

          Setting &setting = config.lookup("application.window.size.w");
          setting = 1024;

     If the assignment is invalid due to a type mismatch, a
     'SettingTypeException' is thrown.

 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator[] (int INDEX)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator[] (const std::string &NAME)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & operator[] (const char *NAME)

     A 'Setting' object may be subscripted with an integer index INDEX
     if it is an array or list, or with either a string NAME or an
     integer index INDEX if it is a group.  For example, the following
     code would produce the string 'Last Name' when applied to the
     example configuration in *note Configuration Files::.

          Setting& setting = config.lookup("application.misc");
          const char *s = setting["columns"][0];

     If the setting is not an array, list, or group, a
     'SettingTypeException' is thrown.  If the subscript (INDEX or NAME)
     does not refer to a valid element, a 'SettingNotFoundException' is
     thrown.

     Iterating over a group's child settings with an integer index will
     return the settings in the same order that they appear in the
     configuration.

 -- Method on Setting: Setting & lookup (const char * PATH)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & lookup (const std::string &PATH)

     This function locates a setting by a path PATH relative to this
     setting.  If requested setting is not found, a
     'SettingNotFoundException' is thrown.

 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const char *NAME, bool &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const std::string &NAME,
          bool &VALUE)

 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const char *NAME, int &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const std::string &NAME,
          int &VALUE)

 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const char *NAME,
          unsigned int &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const std::string &NAME,
          unsigned int &VALUE)

 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const char *NAME,
          long long &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const std::string &NAME,
          long long &VALUE)

 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const char *NAME,
          unsigned long long &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const std::string &NAME,
          unsigned long long &VALUE)

 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const char *NAME, float &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const std::string &NAME,
          float &VALUE)

 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const char *NAME,
          double &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const std::string &NAME,
          double &VALUE)

 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const char *NAME,
          const char *&VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const std::string &NAME,
          const char *&VALUE)

 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const char *NAME,
          std::string &VALUE)
 -- Method on Setting: bool lookupValue (const std::string &NAME,
          std::string &VALUE)

     These are convenience methods for looking up the value of a child
     setting with the given NAME.  If the setting is found and is of an
     appropriate type, the value is stored in VALUE and the method
     returns 'true'.  Otherwise, VALUE is left unmodified and the method
     returns 'false'.  These methods do not throw exceptions.

     Storage for const char * values is managed by the library and
     released automatically when the setting is destroyed or when its
     value is changed; the string must not be freed by the caller.  For
     safety and convenience, always assigning string values to a
     'std::string' is suggested.

     Since these methods have boolean return values and do not throw
     exceptions, they can be used within boolean logic expressions.  The
     following example presents a concise way to look up three values at
     once and perform error handling if any of them are not found or are
     of the wrong type:


          int var1;
          double var2;
          const char *var3;

          if(setting.lookupValue("var1", var1)
             && setting.lookupValue("var2", var2)
             && setting.lookupValue("var3", var3))
          {
            // use var1, var2, var3
          }
          else
          {
            // error handling here
          }

     This approach also takes advantage of the short-circuit evaluation
     rules of C++, e.g., if the first lookup fails (returning 'false'),
     the remaining lookups are skipped entirely.

 -- Method on Setting: Setting & add (const std::string &NAME,
          Setting::Type TYPE)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & add (const char *NAME,
          Setting::Type TYPE)

     These methods add a new child setting with the given NAME and TYPE
     to the setting, which must be a group.  They return a reference to
     the new setting.  If the setting already has a child setting with
     the given name, or if the name is invalid, a 'SettingNameException'
     is thrown.  If the setting is not a group, a 'SettingTypeException'
     is thrown.

     Once a setting has been created, neither its name nor type can be
     changed.

 -- Method on Setting: Setting & add (Setting::Type TYPE)

     This method adds a new element to the setting, which must be of
     type 'TypeArray' or 'TypeList'.  If the setting is an array which
     currently has zero elements, the TYPE parameter (which must be
     'TypeInt', 'TypeInt64', 'TypeFloat', 'TypeBool', or 'TypeString')
     determines the type for the array; otherwise it must match the type
     of the existing elements in the array.

     The method returns the new setting on success.  If TYPE is a scalar
     type, the new setting will have a default value of 0, 0.0, 'false',
     or 'NULL', as appropriate.

     The method throws a 'SettingTypeException' if the setting is not an
     array or list, or if TYPE is invalid.

 -- Method on Setting: void remove (const std::string &NAME)
 -- Method on Setting: void remove (const char *NAME)

     These methods remove the child setting with the given NAME from the
     setting, which must be a group.  Any child settings of the removed
     setting are recursively destroyed as well.

     If the setting is not a group, a 'SettingTypeException' is thrown.
     If the setting does not have a child setting with the given name, a
     'SettingNotFoundException' is thrown.

 -- Method on Setting: void remove (unsigned int INDEX)

     This method removes the child setting at the given index INDEX from
     the setting, which must be a group, list, or array.  Any child
     settings of the removed setting are recursively destroyed as well.

     If the setting is not a group, list, or array, a
     'SettingTypeException' is thrown.  If INDEX is out of range, a
     'SettingNotFoundException' is thrown.

 -- Method on Setting: const char * getName ()

     This method returns the name of the setting, or 'NULL' if the
     setting has no name.  Storage for the returned string is managed by
     the library and released automatically when the setting is
     destroyed; the string must not be freed by the caller.  For safety
     and convenience, consider assigning the return value to a
     'std::string'.

 -- Method on Setting: std::string getPath ()

     This method returns the complete dot-separated path to the setting.
     Settings which do not have a name (list and array elements) are
     represented by their index in square brackets.

 -- Method on Setting: Setting & getParent ()

     This method returns the parent setting of the setting.  If the
     setting is the root setting, a 'SettingNotFoundException' is
     thrown.

 -- Method on Setting: bool isRoot ()

     This method returns 'true' if the setting is the root setting, and
     'false' otherwise.

 -- Method on Setting: int getIndex ()

     This method returns the index of the setting within its parent
     setting.  When applied to the root setting, this method returns -1.

 -- Method on Setting: Setting::Type getType ()

     This method returns the type of the setting.  The 'Setting::Type'
     enumeration consists of the following constants: 'TypeInt',
     'TypeInt64', 'TypeFloat', 'TypeString', 'TypeBoolean', 'TypeArray',
     'TypeList', and 'TypeGroup'.

 -- Method on Setting: Setting::Format getFormat ()
 -- Method on Setting: void setFormat (Setting::Format FORMAT)

     These methods get and set the external format for the setting.

     The SETTING::FORMAT enumeration consists of the following
     constants: 'FormatDefault' and 'FormatHex'.  All settings support
     the 'FormatDefault' format.  The 'FormatHex' format specifies
     hexadecimal formatting for integer values, and hence only applies
     to settings of type 'TypeInt' and 'TypeInt64'.  If FORMAT is
     invalid for the given setting, it is ignored.

 -- Method on Setting: bool exists (const std::string &NAME)
 -- Method on Setting: bool exists (const char *NAME)

     These methods test if the setting has a child setting with the
     given NAME.  They return 'true' if the setting exists, and 'false'
     otherwise.  These methods do not throw exceptions.

 -- Method on Setting: iterator begin ()
 -- Method on Setting: iterator end ()
 -- Method on Setting: const_iterator begin ()
 -- Method on Setting: const_iterator end ()

     These methods return STL-style iterators that can be used to
     enumerate the child settings of a given setting.  If the setting is
     not an array, list, or group, they throw a 'SettingTypeException'.

 -- Method on Setting: int getLength ()

     This method returns the number of settings in a group, or the
     number of elements in a list or array.  For other types of
     settings, it returns 0.

 -- Method on Setting: bool isGroup ()
 -- Method on Setting: bool isArray ()
 -- Method on Setting: bool isList ()

     These convenience methods test if a setting is of a given type.

 -- Method on Setting: bool isAggregate ()
 -- Method on Setting: bool isScalar ()
 -- Method on Setting: bool isNumber ()

     These convenience methods test if a setting is of an aggregate type
     (a group, array, or list), of a scalar type (integer, 64-bit
     integer, floating point, boolean, or string), and of a number
     (integer, 64-bit integer, or floating point), respectively.

 -- Method on Setting: const char * getSourceFile ()

     This function returns the name of the file from which the setting
     was read, or NULL if the setting was not read from a file.  This
     information is useful for reporting application-level errors.
     Storage for the returned string is managed by the library and
     released automatically when the configuration is destroyed; the
     string must not be freed by the caller.

 -- Method on Setting: unsigned int getSourceLine ()

     This function returns the line number of the configuration file or
     stream at which the setting SETTING was read, or 0 if no line
     number is available.  This information is useful for reporting
     application-level errors.

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
version number 2.1.]


                               Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software-to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages-typically libraries-of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified
by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
have is not the original version, so that the original author's
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by
others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any
patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent
with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is
quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this
license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries
into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire
combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the
library.

   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public
License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an
advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the
reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special
circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library
does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case,
there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software
only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,
as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION


  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
     program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
     other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
     of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
     Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
     which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
     Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter,
     translation is included without limitation in the term
     "modification".)

     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code
     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the library.

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
     output from such a program is covered only if its contents
     constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
     the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the
     Library does.


  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
     that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
     along with the Library.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
     it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The modified work must itself be a software library.


       b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.


       c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.


       d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
          a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
          uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
          facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to
          ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
          function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
          whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
          application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function
          must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
          square root function must still compute square roots.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
     to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But
     when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
     work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on
     the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
     extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
     regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Library.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a
     volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
     work under the scope of this License.


  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To
     do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,
     so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
     version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than
     version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared,
     then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not
     make any other change in these notices.

     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
     Library into a program that is not a library.


  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
     of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
     terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
     the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
     be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
     medium customarily used for software interchange.

     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
     the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.


  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
     or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such
     a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
     therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses
     the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
     Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may
     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
     defined by law.

     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.


  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link
     a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
     containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under
     terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification
     of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for
     debugging such modifications.

     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
     by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the
     work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include
     the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
     reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also,
     you must do one of these things:


       a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code for the Library including
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is
          an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
          machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
          and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
          and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
          the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who
          changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
          not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use
          the modified definitions.)


       b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run
          time a copy of the library already present on the user's
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into
          the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
          version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as
          the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
          that the work was made with.


       c. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
          three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
          Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
          performing this distribution.


       d. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
          from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the
          above specified materials from the same place.


       e. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
     exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.

     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that
     you distribute.


  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such
     a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the
     work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
     otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:


       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
          Sections above.


       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
          where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
          work.


  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
     Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received
     copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
     licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
     compliance.


  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License
     to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.


  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose
     any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties with this License.


  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive
     copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
     could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
     from distribution of the Library.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.


  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.


  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to
     it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not
     specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
     published by the Free Software Foundation.


  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
     write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
     status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
     sharing and reuse of software generally.


                              NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
     FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
     PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE
     DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
     OR CORRECTION.


  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.


<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307  USA


   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:


Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
